// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
// because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
// describing what the program does.



// program created by Nadeem Ahmed

// this program will print my name. 

console.log("Nadeem Ahmed");
